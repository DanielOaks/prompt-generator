# Prompts Webapp

This is a little webapp I use to generate character/location/scene prompts for stories, illustrations, etc. It's a static PWA built using Jekyll.


## Building

1. Install [Bundler](https://bundler.io).
2. Install [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).
3. Either `npm run serve` (dev), or `npm run build` (prod).

You can also install `nodemon` and run that command for dev testing -- that'll automagically rebuild Vue changes as well.
